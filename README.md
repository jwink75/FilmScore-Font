# FilmScore Font

FilmScore is made under the SIL Open Font License, and uses glyphs from other SIL OFL fonts: Bravura, Avrile Serif, and Avrile Sans. The latter were chosen for their legibility at small sizes.

## Usage

FilmScore can be used to build streamer, punch, and warning click notations in music notation software, particularly Dorico as currently text objects attached to the top staff are currently (as of Dorico 3.5) the only viable means of producing streamer lines (‘lines’ cannot be hidden in Dorico).

In general, lowercase calls for sans serif glyphs while uppercase calls for serif. This is true of both the streamer color glyphs, as well as the warning click glyphs.

## Streamers

You can build custom streamers using just the – and | keys, or use these in conjunction with the color keys streamers. The ] key contains a medium-short prebuilt streamer, and + is a punch.

You can choose sans serif or serif according to the aesthetic of your score.

## Warning Clix

You can make warning clix using the q, e, Q, and E keys. The q variations let you put in quarter note clix, and the e varieties add beamed eighths.
